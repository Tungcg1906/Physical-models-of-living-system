Project: Modelling small-patterned neuronal networks coupled to microelectrode arrays

Abstract: This project based on paper " Modelling small-patterned neuronal networks coupled to microelectrode arrays" (Journal of Neural Engineering 2008, P.Massobrio, S.Martinoia) investigates a neuronal network model that captures patterned network dynamics. It incorporates meta-neurons with defined morphology and connectivity, tested using experimental data from microelectrodes patterned networks. The model and its variations are simulated, including one-to-many and one-to-nearest neighbors configurations, along with spiking neuron activity. The simulations aim to replicate observed spontaneous activity and evoked responses, validating the model's ability to reproduce network dynamics. The study emphasizes the significance of meta-neuron morphology and direct connections between non-neighboring microelectrodes. It contributes to understanding patterned neuronal networks and informs the design of specific network architectures, aiding experimental and hybrid systems with predefined features. Overall, this project presents a comprehensive analysis of the model's implications for studying patterned neuronal networks.
